# Course: AI for Data Analysis ‚Äî Student Welcome Guide

Welcome to the **AI for Data Analysis** course!  

This class combines finance and data science with large language models (LLMs).  
You will learn how to extract insights from documents and datasets, code in Python within Jupyter notebooks, and compare the performance of local and cloud-based AI models.  

This guide explains what to expect and (optionally) what software you should install ahead of time.

## üìö Course Overview

- **Data analysis in finance**: parsing PDF reports, working with CSV datasets  
- **Python + Jupyter**: coding, plotting, summarizing results  
- **Local LLMs**: run models like *Gemma:1B* through [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for privacy  
- **Cloud LLMs**: compare with ChatGPT to evaluate accuracy and usability  
- **Teamwork**: you‚Äôll work in groups of 2‚Äì3 and present results at the end

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools to Install Beforehand

You can already try to install these tools on your laptop.  
Don‚Äôt worry if you have problems, part of the course will be **learning how to fix installation problems together**.
 

### 1. **Conda**
Note: If you already can run Python programs on your computer, you do not need this step.

- Conda is an **all-in-one Python enviroment** 
- Download at: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/
](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)  


### 2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
Note: If you prefer another IDE (e.g. PyCharm), you can skip this step.

- VS Code is a popular, lightweight **code editor** with Python support  
- Download from: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download
](https://code.visualstudio.com/download
)  
- Install the **Python extension** (from Microsoft) to run and debug Jupyter notebooks  


### 3. **GitHub Copilot**
- Popular **AI-assitant for coding tasks**. 
- Activate it for free from: [https://github.com/features/copilot
](https://github.com/features/copilot
)  
- Install the plugin in you IDE (e.g. for VSCode: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup))


### 4. **Ollama**
- Tool to **run large language models locally** with privacy and offline support  
- Download: [https://ollama.com/download
](https://ollama.com/download
)  
- Download a specific: you can run `ollama run gemma:1b` from the terminal.  


### 5. **ChatGPT**
- Desktop app for **Python data analysis**  
- Download from: [https://chatgpt.com/download/]([https://chatgpt.com/download/])
- If you do not want to install it, also chatting in the browser version is okay.

## üí° Important Notes

- **Troubleshooting** is part of the course: we expect some installation problems, and solving them is a learning exercise.  
- Please try to **install the tools before the first lab session**, so we can focus on fixing issues and starting with data analysis.  
- Make sure your laptop has enough disk space and preferably 8GB+ RAM for running local LLMs.
